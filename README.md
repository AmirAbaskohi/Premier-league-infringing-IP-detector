The Premier League, also known as the English Premier League or the EPL, is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League. Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches.

## Problem
As Premier Leauge is one of the most popular soccer leagues in the world, a lot of people love to watch these games. But all of the does not intend to do it legally. So detecting these pople is so importnat.

## How it works?
This code is implemeted as a distributed system to handle large information. I used `Apache Airflow`, which is an open-source workflow management platform for data engineering pipelines. It started at Airbnb in October 2014 as a solution to manage the company's increasingly complex workflows.

Different `Machine Learning` models are used in this project. Some of them are listed here:
* Simple classifier which is called model_one
* XGBoost
* MLM
